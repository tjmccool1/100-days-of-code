# 100 Days Of Code - Log

<!--
### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.

### Day 0: 12 October 2020

**Today's Progress**: Comitted to the challenge. started setting up mac for dev again.

**Thoughts:** Amazing how much I forgot and remembered. also need to speed up and stay on task :)

### Day 1: 13 October 2020

**Today's Progress**: decided that i am going to go back through Codeup work and restart FreeCodeCamp. Still working on setting up again.


**Thoughts:** staying on task is stilll difficult for me and i need to remember how to us git and git hub. Also figuring out which editor to use is not fun. so far BBedit is my goto but i am going to try to work with and learn different ones.

### Day 2: 14 October 2020

**Today's Progress:** figured out a bit of markdown lang again; making first commit in a long time.

**Thoughts:** now i wonder if i remember how....

cd Documents/100-days-of-code
git status
git add log.md
git commit -m "comments"
Oh and now i remember to create my own branch.
git branch mine
git checkout mine
git status
git add log.md
git commit -m "comments"

### Day 3: 15 October 2020

**Today's Progress:** well ended up reading today instead of actually coding. arggghhhh

**Thoughts:** none for today.

### Day 4: 16 October 2020

**Today's Progress:** started working Hacker1 CTF.  completed 50% of FreeCodeCamp HTML lessons. creating template for this log

**Thoughts:**  definitely need alot of refresher. it felt good to try some hacking and remebering some tools. and HTML is pretty easy. HTML is comming back pretty quick. really like Atom for my editor
