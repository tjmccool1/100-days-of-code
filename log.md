### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.

### Day 0: 12 October 2020

**Today's Progress**: Comitted to the challenge. started setting up mac for dev again.

**Thoughts:** Amazing how much I forgot and remembered. also need to speed up and stay on task :)

### Day 1: 13 October 2020

**Today's Progress**: decided that i am going to go back through Codeup work and restart FreeCodeCamp. Still working on setting up again.


**Thoughts:** staying on task is stilll difficult for me and i need to remember how to us git and git hub. Also figuring out which editor to use is not fun. so far BBedit is my goto but i am going to try to work with and learn different ones.

### Day 2: 14 October 2020

**Today's Progress:** figured out a bit of markdown lang again; making first commit in a long time. 

**Thoughts:** now i wonder if i remember how.... 

cd Documents/100-days-of-code
git status
git add log.md
git commit -m "comments"
Oh and now i remember to create my own branch.
git branch mine
git checkout mine
