We are going to check if xcode and brew are installed, and if you have ssh keys setup.
We will then setup our java development environment, including installing MySQL,
and a mild bit of git configuration.

All together we will be installing: 
  - xcode tools   - brew
  - java		  - maven
  - tomcat		- mysql
  - node
*Note*: if you have already setup any of the above on your computer, this script will _not_
		attempt to reinstall them, please talk to an instructor to ensure everything
		is configured properly

During this process you may be asked for your password several times. This is the password
you use to log into your computer. When you type it in, you will not see any output in the
terminal, this is normal.

Press Enter to continue or Ctrl-C to exit

We are now going to use homebrew to install java. While your mac comes
with a version of java, it may not be the most recent version, and we want
to make sure everyone is on the version.
